1. **Financial Health Score:** 7/10  
- The individual has a positive cash flow of $1,150/month ($2000 income - $850 expenses), which is a good foundation.  
- Debt level ($1000) is relatively low compared to income, which is positive.  

2. **Three Specific Improvements:**  
- **Debt Repayment Plan:** Allocate a portion of the monthly surplus to pay down the $1000 debt aggressively to avoid unnecessary interest and improve credit health.  
- **Emergency Fund:** Start or build an emergency fund with 3-6 months’ worth of expenses (~$2550 to $5100) to provide financial security against unexpected expenses.  
- **Optimize Expenses:** Review the $850 monthly expenses to identify any non-essential spending that can be reduced or eliminated to increase monthly savings or investments.  

3. **One Aggressive Wealth-Building Tip:**  
- **Invest Surplus Monthly Income:** Utilize the $1,150 surplus to invest consistently in diversified assets such as low-cost index funds, ETFs, or retirement accounts. Compounding returns over time will significantly build wealth. Consider automating these investments to maintain discipline and grow wealth aggressively.
